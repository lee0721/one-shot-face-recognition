# one-shot-face-recognition
This project implements a Few-Shot Learning-based Face Recognition Attendance System using Triplet Network, SimCLR, and Ensemble Learning. It improves recognition accuracy with minimal training data, providing an efficient and robust attendance solution while overcoming the limitations of traditional models requiring large datasets.
